# AgentFi ðŸ¤–

> Your personal AI-powered DeFi agent that lives as an NFT, managing complex DeFi strategies through natural language while securing assets in its own Token Bound Account.

## Overview

AgentFi transforms DeFi accessibility by introducing AI-powered financial agents that live as NFTs. Each agent is a unique digital entity with its own secure wallet (powered by Token Bound Accounts/ERC-6551) and investment personality. Through natural language interactions, users can delegate complex DeFi operations - from yield farming to cross-chain bridging - to their personalized agent, making DeFi as simple as having a conversation with your digital financial assistant.
